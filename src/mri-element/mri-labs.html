          <p>Upon arrival for your MRI research scan, one of our research assistants will meet you in the main lobby of the hospital and bring you to the MRI facility located in the Department of Radiology. You will be checked in for your appointment, and will fill out safety screening questionnaires for both you and your child. This form will ensure that your child can be safely imaged using MRI, and that you can safely accompany them into the MRI room if you choose to do so. The RA will then bring you to the patient preparation room, where your child will be able to get comfortable and familiar with the new environment. We can provide your child with toys, books, warm blankets, and coloring materials.</p>
