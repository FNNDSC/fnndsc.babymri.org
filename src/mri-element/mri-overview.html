              <p>Together the MRI Laboratory and the NIRS Laboratory work with families to discover environmental influences on early brain development, as well as test novel therapeutics to improve the health of NICU-admitted infants. </p>

              <h3>What We Do</h3>
              <p>We utilize the imaging modality of MRI to acquire high-resolution structural and functional images, including resting-state MRI (rsMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in order to assess early brain development from birth to two years of age.

The MRI team pioneers innovations with non-sedated MRI for the challenging 1-4 year old population. Through regular collaboration, we are integrating research and clinical practice to yield efficiently run scans with improved image quality.

              <h3>How We Do It</h3>
              <p>With our non-sedated, no-contrast MRI, we continue to facilitate safe, non-invasive sessions, to condone positive perceptions of newborn research, to produce quality data, and to progress through expanding knowledge in the field of newborn medicine.</p>
