              <h3>Who We Are</h3>
              <p>Together the Grant Laboratory and the NIRS Laboratory work with families to discover environmental influences on early brain development, as well as test novel therapeutics to improve the health of NICU-admitted infants. </p>

              <h3>What We Do</h3>
              <p>We utilize the imaging modality of MRI to acquire high-resolution structural and functional images, including resting-state MRI (rsMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in order to assess early brain development from birth to two years of age. 

The MRI team pioneers innovations with non-sedated MRI for the challenging 1-4 year old population. Through regular collaboration, we are integrating research and clinical practice to yield efficiently run scans with improved image quality.

              <h3>How We Do It</h3>
              <p>We use MRI's to supplement our research projects with data. To help forward medicine for children.</p>

              <h3>What are MRI's</h3>
              <p>This first video shows the basics and the procedure for children going through an MRI. The video was was created by Boston Children’s Hospital. </p> 
              <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wWVihGpcjk</p>
              <p> This second video is also talking about MRI’s but specifically to a research project that was conducted by Nadine Gaab. The research focused on children who were diagnosed or at risk for developmental disorders narrowing in on language-based learning disabilities. This video is helpful for showing a specific way that MRI was used at Boston Children’s Hospital. </p>
