              <p>We are a group of researchers under FNNDSC that use MRI’s to further research and understanding of the development of children’s brains by directly looking at the brain.</p>

              <h3>What we do</h3>
              <p>We push the boundaries of research in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).</p>
              <p>We develop new technologies that can lead to improvements in healthcare for infants and children.</p>

          <h4>What are MRI's</h4>
          <p>This first video shows the basics and the procedure for children going through an MRI. The video was was created by Boston Children’s Hospital. </p> 
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wWVihGpcjk</p>
          <p> This second video is also talking about MRI’s but specifically to a research project that was conducted by Nadine Gaab. The research focused on children who were diagnosed or at risk for developmental disorders narrowing in on language-based learning disabilities. This video is helpful for showing a specific way that MRI was used at Boston Children’s Hospital. </p>
