          <h2>Using Advanced MRI Methods to Study the Effect of Early Environment on Human Brain Development </h2>

            <div align="justify">
              <p>Pre- and post-natal environmental factors such as nutrition, education and socio-economic-status (SES) of the family, stress levels in the household, mother-child interactions, and early language exposure play a critical role in the development and connectivity of the young infant brain, which has increased plasticity, and play an important role in determining eventual cognitive and behavioral outcomes. However, few studies to date have examined the affects of environmental factors on the development of structural and functional brain networks and associated cognitive and behavioural outcome measures. MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to provide a wide variety of information about brain structure, myelination, chemistry, and connectivity. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides an indirect measure of brain myelination by measuring the restriction of water diffusion along tracks of aligned axons (Hagmann et al., 2010). These measures change dramatically during the first two years of life as myelination occurs, and therefore provide sensitive measure of brain development. These measures are highly sensitive to the dramatic changes that occur during early brain development, and they are predictive of future developmental outcomes.  To investigate this we will perform a longitudinal study in which we compare the results of MRI scans on healthy full term infants at several time points within the first year of life with information about environmental factors. More specifically, families will come in for two 3-4 hour visits at Boston Children’s Hospital at ages 1 month and 3-8 months, as well as for two visits at Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the same time  points. The proposed project will lay the groundwork for future clinical trials in which we would be able to influence the success of prevention and intervention strategies for optimal brain development.</p>

          <h2>The Effect of Myelin-Relevant Nutrients in Infant Formula on Brain Myelination and Cognitive Development</h2>

            <div align="justify">

              <p>The brain contains billions of nerve cells that connect and communicate via fiber pathways. In order to communicate fast and efficiently and not to lose information sent along those fibers, an insulating fat layer called myelin sheath develops around the fibers. This is called myelination. Myelination is a developmental process ensuring coordinated communication between brain cells and networks. It is thus an expression of the functional maturity of the brain and a cornerstone of human neurodevelopment (Barkovich 2005; Dean et al. 2014). Factors that influence myelination and white matter development include genetics, biological factors, and environmental factors, with nutrition potentially being the biggest modifiable factor in early life. To date, however, little is known with regard to the impact of nutrition on de novo myelination, especially in healthy infants and young children. The aim of the current study is therefore, to investigate the efficacy of a blend of myelin-relevant nutrients in infant formula on de novo myelination and cognitive development/learning in reference to breastfed infants in the first year of life of healthy infants. We are asking mothers and their babies to take part in a double blind, randomized, controlled, parallel group, adaptive group sequential clinical trial on brain development during infancy and early childhood. The study will involve the mother, completing self-reported questionnaires and assessments about herself and her baby. The study will involve taking pictures of the baby’s brain while they are asleep via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when the baby is 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months old. The baby will also undergo short cognitive tests as well as functional tests where their language, motor control and eyesight will be evaluated. The information that these tests will generate will help the study team better understand how myelination, the maturing of the brain, affects the functional development of the brain.</p>

          <h2>Neurobiology of Mothering and Infant Stress</h2>

            <div align="justify">
              <p>The relationship between mother and child is the most important human attachment, with significant implications for children’s development.  This crucial relationship is sculpted by the mother’s early experiences, often leading to the intergenerational transmission of abusive or neglectful behaviors, and heightened risk for mental illness and addiction in both parent and child. One of the most important consequences of exposure to childhood maltreatment appears to be reprogramming of stress response systems, leading to either heightened or blunted cortisol responses to stressful stimuli. The current application proposes a series of assessments evaluating the linkages among maternal maltreatment history, structural and functional brain differences, and neuroendocrine responses, and their relations to infant attachment, cortisol regulation, and amygdala volume and connectivity during the first year of life.</p>
