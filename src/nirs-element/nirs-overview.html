        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>Within the greater FNNDSC, we are a team of researchers utilizing the combined optical techniques of frequency-domain near infrared spectroscopy and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (FDNIRS-DCS), or NIRS for short, to better understand neonatal cerebral oxygen metabolism. Our overarching goal is to develop an instrument utilizing this technology that is capable of continuous, non-invasive bedside monitoring of newborn brain health and development.</p>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>To complete our NIRS studies, we visit eligible newborns at the bedside with our FDNIRS-DCS device and use a non-invasive optical probe on several locations of their head. This process is gentle and we communicate with the medical staff and family to ensure it is as smooth and convenient as possible, while also always setting the baby’s comfort as the top priority. After the baby has been discharged, we invite them back for follow up visits that may coincide with clinical appointments for additional NIRS measurements, an unsedated research MRI, and neurobehavioral assessments to correlate our NIRS measurements with long-term outcomes.</p>

        <h3>How We Do It</h3>
        <p>Our FDNIRS-DCS device provides quantitative measures of cerebral blood volume/flow and and cerebral oxygen saturation and consumption. We collect this information after birth during the initial hospital stay to understand brain health of newborns with different conditions, including intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus (“IVH” study), perinatal brain injury caused by a hypoxic event during birth (“PBI/HIE/Therapeutic Cooling” study), and congenital heart disease (“Cardiac” study). Another study, following premature infants undergoing blood transfusions, will begin soon as well. In addition to our NIRS measures, we also collect other information such as magnetic resonance imaging and neurobehavioral assessments at a later stage to better understand brain health and developmental outcomes.</p>
