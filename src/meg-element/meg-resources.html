              <p>Special care has been taken to ensure a safe, comfortable, child friendly
                environment for research participants and BCH patients alike. While the child
                is getting comfortable and prepared for a recording we can provide toys, books,
                coloring materials, or a tablet to watch cartoons. The facility itself has been
                made a welcoming and fun environment with various stickers and wall decals. In case
                of emergency there is a hospital bed, code cart, as well oxygen, air, nitrous
                oxide, and waste anesthetic gas disposal.</p>

              <h3>Hardware</h3>
              <p>The MagView Biomagnetometer, or “BabyMEG”, is a 375-channel
                magnetoencephalography (MEG) system manufactured by Tristan Technologies and is specifically
                designed to study the electrophysiological development of the human brain during the first years of life
                (the helmet provides whole head coverage for 95% of 36-month old boys). The BabyMEG has a total
                of 375 sensors structured in a unique two-layer design. The inner layer consists of 270 magnetometers
                (10 mm diameter, ~15 mm coil-to-coil spacing), the outer layer has 35 three-axis magnetometers (20
                mm x 20 mm), and there are also 3 three-axis reference magnetometers
                 (<u><A HREF = "http://www.tristantech.com/">Tristan Tech</A></u>).</p>

              <h3>Software</h3>
              <p>The BabyMEG data acquisition software, MNE-Scan, has been developed as part of a
                collaboration with Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at MGH and the Technische
                Universität Ilmenau. It provides features such as online averaging, real time source localization, and
                records data in .fif file format. This open source platform functions as a part of the greater MNE-CPP
                framework; for further information, please refer to the MNE-CPP website at
                <u><A HREF = "http://www.mne-cpp.org/">MNE-CPP</A></u>.</p>

            <div>
              <p>The BabyMEG is located in a lightly shielded, two-layer MSR (Vacuumschmeltz model Basic+) with a
                6.4 cm gap between the layers. The needs of patients were carefully considered when installing the
                MSR. The floor of the MSR is at the same level as the floor of the MEG participant preparation area to
                facilitate ease of transfer for patients and emergency equipment between rooms.</p>

          <p>A closed-cycle helium recycler provides continuous operation without interruption during MEG
measurements. The helium recycler utilized was manufactured by Cryomech Inc.
   (<u><A HREF = "http://www.cryomech.com/">Cryomech</A></u>). This virtually maintenance-free system greatly reduces operation cost and the
  need for helium refills. </p>

 are two child size caps, one with 32 channels and one with 128 channels. There are three small
sized caps, one with 32 channels and two with 128 channels. The EEG system also provides the option
 to monitor eye blinks/movement, heartbeats, and muscle activity with EOG, ECG, and EMG
electrodes. </p>

      <p>The MSR is equipped with two full-range, 15.5” x 18” x 69”, electrostatic loudspeakers. These
speakers, manufactured by Sanders Sound Systems (<u><A HREF = "http://www.sanderssoundsystems.com/">Sanders Sound Systems</A></u>),
operate on high voltage rather than magnetism and thus do not produce magnetic fields that interfere with MEG signals. ESL impedance is 112 ohms at 500 Hz falling to 1.2 ohms at 20
KHz. Features include a digital crossover system, which includes an automated, room correction
system and full DSP equalization capabilities. Further technical specifications available upon request
from Sanders Sound Systems.</p>

          <h3>Head Digitization:</h3>
<p>Two options for head digitization, the Polhemus FASTRAK and the Polhemus FastSCAN II, provide a
noninvasive method for obtaining a 3D image of the child’s head. These systems help determine the
 relative position of the child’s head inside the MEG helmet and also allow for precise registration to an
