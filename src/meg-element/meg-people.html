          <div style="text-align: center;"><IMG SRC="../../images/meg/Okada_Yoshio.JPG" width="210" height="300"></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <div style="text-align: center;"</div>
<p>Associate Scientific Researcher at Boston Children's Hospital</p>
<p>Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>Director, MEG Program </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Okada received his PhD from the Rockefeller University in New York City in the fields of </p>
<p>psychology and neuroscience. He is the pioneer in the study of the physiological basis of </p>
<p>magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). He has established through his </p>
<p>research carried out over a period of 25 years that these two noninvasive techniques provide direct</p>
<p>measurements of the electrophysiological activity of synchronously active neurons. Dr. Okada has </p>
<p>made contributions to the development of novel biomagnetic instruments that have opened new ways to </p>
<p>study the electrophysiology of the brain and is an inventor of new instruments that are either completed</p>
<p>and in use or in the process of development. These instruments include a pediatric MEG system called </p>
<p>“babySQUID”, the first of its kind optimized for studying the electrophysiological development of </p>
<p>human brain, a second-generation pediatric MEG system called “babyMEG”, which is based on the </p>
<p>babySQUID, but provides a whole-head coverage with sensitivities and spatial resolution that are </p>
<p>higher than any existing MEG instruments, an inverted SQUID (superconducting quantum interference </p>
<p>device) microscope capable of simultaneously measuring biomagnetic fields, electrical potentials and </p>
<p>optical images from biological preparations and a whole-head cryogenically cooled Transcranial </p>
<p>Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) system that will provide unique novel methods for studying functional </p>
<p>networks of the human brain. Dr. Okada was a founder of a center called “Biomedical Research and </p>
<p>Integrative Neuroimaging Center” or BRaIN Imaging Center at the University of New Mexico prior to </p>
<p>joining Harvard Medical School.</p>

  <div style="align: center;"><IMG SRC="../../images/meg/Ahtam_Banu.JPG" width="210" height="300"></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard Medicial School</p>
  <p>Associate Scientific Research Staff at Boston Children's Hospital</p>
  <p>Manager, MEG Program </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Dr. Ahtam received her undergraduate degree in Psychology from Koc University in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
 <p>She received a Master of Science degree from the Experimental Psychology Department of the</p>
 <p>University of Oxford. She completed her doctoral studies at the Psychiatry Department in the</p>
 <p>University of Oxford as a Clarendon Scholar. For her doctoral project, she focused on language</p>
 <p>processing in autism spectrum disorders and typically developing children, using MEG, behavioral,</p>
 <p>and neuropsychiatric measures. Since June 2011, at BCH, she has been leading and working on</p>
 <p>important projects that will help us understand the brain structure and function of neurodevelopmental</p>
 <p>disorders using multimodal noninvasive imaging techniques. She is experienced in MEG, EEG, DTI,</p>
 <p>sMRI, and rs-fMRI, including protocol design, data acquisition, and statistical processing. She is also</p>
 <p>deeply familiar with pediatric neuroimaging research of neurodevelopmental disorders and has a</p>
 <p>strong background in neuropsychological measures. In addition to conducting research, she is also the</p>
 <p>manager of the MEG Program. </p>

 <div style="align: center;"><IMG SRC="../../images/meg/limin33.png" width="210" height="210"></div>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard Medicial School</p>
 <p>Associate Scientific Research Staff at Boston Children's Hospital</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Dr. Sun received his masters degree in Biomedical Engineering from China Medical University. He </p>
 <p>received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Otto-von-Guericke University in Germany. For his </p>
 <p>PhD thesis, he worked on Simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI. He completed his first </p>
 <p>postdoctoral fellowship at Max Planck Institute for Brain Research at Frankfurt am Main, Germany.</p>
 <p>His second postdoctoral fellowship was at Mass General Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital</p>
 <p>where he focused on developing the code for the acquisition software of the two pediatric MEG</p>
 <p>systems, BabySQUID and BabyMEG. He has a strong background in signal processing and is</p>
 <p>proficient in several programming languages including C++, C#, Matlab, and LabView. His main</p>
 <p>research interests are the artificial signals removal during the biomedical signal recording, the</p>
 <p>development of MEG acquisition system, embedded coding, and the psychology analysis on Autism</p>
 <p>Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia. </p>

<div style="align: center;"><IMG SRC="../../images/meg/Curran_Ashley.JPG" width="210" height="300"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical Research Coordinator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ashley received her Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry from the University of Massachusetts</P>
<p>Amherst. She has been working as a clinical research coordinator for a few years in the Longwood </p>
<p>Medical Area including the BabyMEG facility. Her primary roles include advertisement of research </p>
<p>studies, recruiting participants and assessing their eligibility for the studies, scheduling and </p>
<p>consenting, documenting studies, and maintaining IRB protocols. She is also involved in data </p>
<p>acquisition and data analysis. She has an interest in neonatology and hopes to continue on to </p>
<p>medical school in the future.

<p>Research Study Assistant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kathryn (Katie) received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Holyoke College where she majored </p>
<p>in Psychology. At the BabyMEG facility, her responsibilities include preparing the lab for</p>
<p>electrophysiological (human) recordings, helping with data acquisition, data organization, data pre-</p>
<p>processing/analysis, helping with recruitment, ordering supplies and equipment for the lab, maintaining</p>
<p>the day-to-day operations, and preparing and organizing documentation. Her primary research interest</p>
<p>is language development and she hopes to become a clinical neuropsychologist in the future. </p>
