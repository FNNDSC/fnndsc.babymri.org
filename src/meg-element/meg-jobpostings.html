          <p>There are currently two internship positions available. One technical intern and one experimental intern.</p>
          <p>The <b>Technical intern</b> will gain experience in the field of human brain development by working with data acquisition and analysis software. Some combination of previous experience with computer programming (MATLAB, Python, C++, etc), signal processing for EEG/MEG analysis (Brainstorm, SPM, Fieldtrip, or MNE), and experimental paradigm preparation (experience with Presentation, eyelink experiment builder) is required. Knowledge of brain anatomy and statistics would be beneficial but not required.</p>
          <p>The <b>Experimental intern</b> will gain experience in the field of human brain development by assisting with data collection and analysis.  This intern should have previous experience working with young children. The intern will prepare the lab for electrophysiological recordings and work with children and families to collect data. Once data is collected she/he will also assist with data organization, data pre-processing, and analysis. Additionally she/he will help prepare and organize documentation for the studies and laboratory (e.g. brochures, family education sheets, study record sheets etc.) </p>
<p><b>All interns must:</b></p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Be currently enrolled at an accredited College or University. Internships at the BabyMEG facility must count towards course credit.</li>
      <li>Have strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work collaboratively with other team members.</li>
      <li>Have strong written and verbal communication skills in English.</li>
      <li>Have very strong organizational skills, must be self-motivated, resourceful, able to multi-task and prioritize.</li>
