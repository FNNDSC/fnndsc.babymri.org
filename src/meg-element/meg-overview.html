              <h3>What is MEG?</h3>
              <p>Magnetoencephalography, or MEG, is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique designed to measure
                brain activity via magnetic fields. Electrical signals associated with neuronal firing
                cause subtle fluctuations in the magnetic fields surrounding the brain.  MEG measures the change
                in these magnetic fields to provide an indirect measure of the strength and location of brain activity.</p>

              <p>The BabyMEG system at BCH is at the forefront of MEG technologies and was one of the first systems designed
              specifically for children 0-4 years of age.  Our system utilizes a two layer array of 375 magnetometers to provide
              extremely sensitive spatial information about brain activity in real time.  The facility itself is ideally located
              across from the NICU to provide ease of access forÂ patients while bringing together researchers, clinicians, and
              engineers to promote an integrated approach to developing technologies and caring for patients.</p>

              <h3>Clinical:</h3>
              <p>Clinically, MEG is most often used to localize seizure activity in patients with epilepsy.  Since FDA approval
                in April 2016, the BabyMEG has been used to evaluate several children with refractory epilepsy prior to surgery.
                Clinical MEG measurements can assist physicians and surgeons by localizing interictal and ictal activity as well
                as eloquent areas of the brain.</p>

              <h3>Research:</h3>
              <p>In addition to its clinical function, MEG is also a valuable research tool for helping our scientists gain insight
                to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders including Cerebral Palsy, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Down Syndrome,
                Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as hearing impairments and vision deficits focal brain
                malformations. We also study the development of the somatosensory, visual, auditory, and motor systems in typically
                developing children.</p>
