          <p>Background / Purpose: The children's research integration system (ChRIS), developed at Boston Children's Hospital, is a novel web-based data storage and data processing workflow manager. It provides strict data security while also facilitating secure, realtime interactive collaboration over the internet and internal intranets.</p>
          <p>Main conclusion: We believe that using web-based metaphors in medical image processing, can lead to increased collaboration and sharing of results and findings. Ultimately, this can contribute to improved clinical care.</p>
          <p>Conference paper: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266156558_ChRIS_real-time_web-based_MRI_data_collection_analysis_and_sharing">here</a></p>
